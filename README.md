# WAI ARIA Compaliant Tabs

This project illustrates a usage of a React tab group component fully compliant with the WAI ARIA specification with details highlighted here https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tabpanel. 

This is an [Automatically Activated](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/tabs/tabs-1/tabs.html) tabs component. 

Active tabs retain their state in a similar manner to native HTML elements including
back/forward navigation and refresh. 

It's possible to directly link to any given tab on a page using a query parameter name attached to each tab group with a prop.

The tabs component is fully operational in Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge.
